
	App Idea :
	
	There will be multiple location in a city from where you can get the Bike. go to your places and then submit the bike at 
	other nearby station when trip ends.
	
	Vehicle class{
		
		String Make&Model;
		Int 	KMDriven;
		int Condition ; 
	
	}	
	
	While Booking :
	
	selectlocation(String Location_from_map);   <- return the location of the station
	
	Get_Availability(); <- return a hashmap with vehicle and no of availability
	
	add_vehicle(String vehicle_id); <- all the details will be shown to user and option to book
	
	Booking_started() <- add all user details with booking id, name, Phone number, photo, Pancard, Aadhar card, DL details and all
	
	Booking_done(); <- generate booking id
		
	
	While submittimg :
	
	check_booking_id(); <- check all the details and while booking was happened. 
	
	Check_vehicle_condition(); <- inspect the vehicle
	
	Check_km_driven()        <- check how many KM is driven if it's for long route. for small 
	
	Calculate_money();   <= if it's not prepaid then calculate based on Km driven and all.
	
	Go_to_payment(String transaction_id) <- do the payment after calculating everything.
	
	
	After Submitting :
		
	Payment_done <- add all value to the database.
	
	generate_invoice  <- generate invoice and send that to customer 
	
	Customer Profile Class{
	
	String Cust_Name ;
	String Cust_email;
	int 	Mobile_no;
	int 	Age;
	Boolean male/Female;
	
	
	Picture of the Person.
	int Pervious_driven;
	int previous_trips;
	
	}
	
	
	Workflow and Architecture :
	
	You have the App.
	Open app and then look for the Nearby station. It will show you the vehicle availability. 
	based on each request it will decrease the availability.
	
	put both Source and Destination and it will show the nearby station to destination.
	
	if you are ok with it will show the expected KM driven and charges.
	
	if you are ok with all it will ask you to Login/register in app. while registering it will	ask for all your details like name, number,email, 
	driving license and other details like 	PAN and AAdhar card number.

	if you are a new customer you need to swipe card for 10K and you will get 5% cash back to card for next 5 transaction. 
	
	you Do the payment go to Station. Pick your Bike <note down the KM driven and all> Then use and	Drop at the nearby station.
	
	Initially we can start with Activa and later we can move to Royal enfield and Harley Davidson.
	
	
	For business Architecture :
	
	No of Bike stations : we can have 4-5 station in city like Bangalore, Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkata
	
	for tourist places like OOTY, Coorg, munnar, chikmanglur, Kodaikanal, Mysore(1 or 2 One near infosys campus). we can have 1-2 Stations. 
	
	for smaller city like Bhopal, Jaipur, Dehradun, mussorie we can have 1-2 staions.

	We can add already renting local vendors to our app and this way we will save alot of trouble finding places, Buying vehicle. 
	
	  
	For Payment :
	
	
	Mostly we will user Paytm. we can discuss this how we can proceed with payment. 
	
	
	The paltform :- 
	
	it will be more like if anybody have some money and he want to invest this to somewhere then he/she will buy some vehicle and add them on our
	platform. if person has some parking space and 3-4 bikes then add them on our app and become a vendor. 
	
	Charges : 
	
	06:00 AM - 10:00 AM: 300 INR
	
	05:00 PM - 08:00 PM  : 300 INR
	
	10:00 AM - 06:00 PM : 500 INR
		36
	Full day    : 06:00 AM-06:00 PM : 600
	Full Night  : 06:00 PM-06:00 AM : 600
	
	Outstation in same State :
	
		Some people lets suppose wanted to go to ooty on bike and then travel back to bangalore in Bus.
		we can rent a bike to them which they can drop in ooty and come back however they want. 
		
		We can have some payment_scheme here as well. 
		
	For paying the vendor :
		
			We can have some calculation/distribution.
